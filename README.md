Ruby Messaging Server With WebSockets
===================================

A way to think about Git and Github.
------------
Milestones of milestones of milestones. In other words:

- Open up a text editor.
- Type "Hello World".
- Save this file.
  - You have now created a "milestone" on your hard drive of this text.
	- You can now retreive that milestone by double clicking it to re-open it in your text editor.
	- This should be a concept you already understand quite well.
- Change the contents of that file again. Add in your own text. Save it again.
	- By saving it again you've overwritten the previous milestone.
	- You can certainly redo the work (e.g. replacing all the text with "Hello World" and saving again) but the original work is gone otherwise.
- Git saves milestones of milestones.

		git commit -am "By typing this command I am saving a collection of saved files."

- This is great because now we can roll back to old versions of files without having to retype. Aka "source control".
- However, wouldn't it be great if we could further save milestones in the cloud?
	- Aka milestones of milestones of milestones.
		- Github -> Git -> Save
- Github is two things:
	- git, in the cloud
	- a social network around source code
- All you need to do to push to Github:

		git push origin master

- Now one could "clone" that repository on another computer and not just get the latest code but the complete revision history on another computer.
